# Quadrata Web3 Passport

This project is a privacy-preserving, sybil-resistant technology that brings identity, compliance, and reputation to DApps built on public blockchains.

# How it works

Businesses and consumers onboard onto Quadrata by attaching their wallets to an identity passport. The Quadrata Passport is issued as a non-transferrable NFT (ERC1155).
DApps integrated with Quadrata can check passport attributes to verify:
- If the user has a passport.
- If the user owns more than one wallet.
- The user's AML risk score.
- From which country the government id was issued.
